# Requirement Analysis in Software Development
Importance

Clarity and Understanding: It helps in understanding what the stakeholders expect from the software, reducing ambiguity.
Scope Definition: Clearly defines the scope of the project, which helps in preventing scope creep.
Basis for Design and Development: Provides a solid foundation for designing and developing the system.
Cost and Time Estimation: Facilitates accurate estimation of project cost, resources, and time.
Quality Assurance: Ensures that the final product meets the specified requirements, leading to higher customer satisfaction.

# What is Requirement Analysis?
Requirement Analysis is one of the most important stages in the software development life cycle (SDLC) in which the development team collects, evaluates and specifies the requirements of the software product to be developed. Through this, the understanding of the stakeholders on what the system should do and how it should perform is clear and is mutual.
