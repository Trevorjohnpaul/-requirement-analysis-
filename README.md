# Requirement Analysis in Software Development
Importance

Clarity and Understanding: It helps in understanding what the stakeholders expect from the software, reducing ambiguity.
Scope Definition: Clearly defines the scope of the project, which helps in preventing scope creep.
Basis for Design and Development: Provides a solid foundation for designing and developing the system.
Cost and Time Estimation: Facilitates accurate estimation of project cost, resources, and time.
Quality Assurance: Ensures that the final product meets the specified requirements, leading to higher customer satisfaction.

# What is Requirement Analysis?
Requirement Analysis is one of the most important stages in the software development life cycle (SDLC) in which the development team collects, evaluates and specifies the requirements of the software product to be developed. Through this, the understanding of the stakeholders on what the system should do and how it should perform is clear and is mutual.

# Key Activities in Requirement Analysis
 -Requirement Gathering:Involves engageing with stakeholders to collect initial requirements.
 -Requirement Elicitation:Refines and elaborate on the gathered requirements.
 -Requirement Documentation:Document the requirements in a detailed and structured format
 -Requirement Analysis and Modeling:Analyzes and prioritizes the requirements.
 -Requirement Validation:Reviews and validates the requirements with stakeholders.

 # Types of Requirements
 Functional Requirements -They describe what the system should do  examples User authentication, property search, booking system, user registration.
 Non-functional Requirements-They describe how the system should perform examples Performance, security, scalability, usability, reliability.

 # Use Case Diagram
 Use case diagrams are diagrams that show how different users  interact with the system to achieve specific goals.

 # Acceptance Criteria.
 Importance :
 
-Ensure all parties have a clear understanding of feature requirements.
-Provide a basis for testing and validation.
-Help in maintaining quality and meeting user expectations.

 Example of Checkout feature:
-Checkout feature must also show booking details, support the choice of the secure payment method, verify the payment information, confirm the successful transactions with the help of receipts, gracefully accept failed payments, and guarantee the encryption of data and adherence to the security requirements of PCI-DSS.
